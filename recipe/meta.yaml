  description: |
    The daops library (pronounced "day-ops") provides a python interface to a
    set of operations suitable for working with climate simulation outputs.
    It is typically used with ESGF data sets that are described in NetCDF files.
    daops is unique in that it accesses a store of fixes defined for data sets
    that are irregular when compared with others in their population.
